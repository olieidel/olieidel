I'm a medical doctor, software engineer and founder. I like to build things.

You can find my rambling on my [blog](https://eidel.io).

Besides that, here's some stuff I've built:

* **[OpenRegulatory](https://openregulatory.com):** A medical device compliance SaaS and consultancy. 5 people
in total, bootstrapped and 100% owned by me.
* **[Digital Health Jobs](https://digital-health-jobs.com):** A job board for, you guessed it, jobs in digital
  health.
* **[Beudamed](https://beudamed.com):** A better European medical device database. Built in 2 months or
  so. Note that the EU is still working on their own version of their medical device database with a team of
  52 people and a budget of â‚¬9M Euros per year.

## Paused Projects

* **[KI-Buchhalter](https://kibuchhalter.de) (German):** An LLM-powered plugin for German bookkeeping
  software. We're using it at OpenRegulatory and it's saving us a huge amount of time, but.. selling this sort
  of plugin to other people seems to be tricky.
* **[Medical Misfits](https://medicalmisfits.com):** A podcast in which I interview doctors who don't work as
  doctors - startup founders, software developers, etc.
